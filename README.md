# Project: Exploring Company Earnings Calls Before and After the COVID-19 Pandemic

Language types: Python

- Description: For the capstone project of my Exploratory Text Analytics class, I chose to investigate how company earnings call language changed before/after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I produced my own raw text dataset by scraping over 35K earnings calls publicly available on the Motley Fool's website, ultimately refining the corpus into a digital analytical edition and conducting text analytics. 
- Data: I sampled ~4k earnings call transcripts between 2018-2022 from a corpus of over 35K earnings call transcripts scraped from the Motley Fool. A more detailed description of the data can be found in "ETA_Manifest Document_04MAY2022.pdf". A zip file of the full, scraped dataset is titled "final_project_SOURCE_FILES.zip", and can be found at the following link: https://virginia.box.com/s/p5i2qqpyerhx7i1s2f4dw33rz33hxct3
- Methods: I conducted several different forms of analysis, to include NLP annotation of corpus terms, topic modeling, principle component analysis (PCA), semantic algebra (through word2vec word embeddings), and sentiment analysis.
- Results: I discovered that the sentiment/language of company leadership surrounding the pandemic varied greatly (and intuitively) based on business models and industry membership. A more detailed descripition of the results can be found in "ETA_Final Report_05MAY2022.pdf".
- Associated files: The data used for this project is described more thoroughly in "ETA_Manifest Document_04MAY2022.pdf". Results and methods are detailed in "ETA_Final Report_05MAY2022.pdf". The code used to scrape and analyze this data is found in "Final Project(2).ipynb".
